# json-api-utils

Monorepo of JSON:API utilities that I'm trying to extract from many private projects.

## Notes

I had to fork `bundt` since it uses `terser@4.8` which doesn't support `?.` but as soon as @lukeed gets around
to updating it (it's a breaking change is why he's waiting) then I can drop my fork.
